# Smart Roofing AI — Project Context

> **Purpose of this file:** the single place that captures *what we are building, why, where things live, the current state, and what's next* — so context is never lost between sessions or people. Update it whenever something material changes.

## 1. What this project is

Smart Roofing AI is an all-in-one CRM **operating system** for roofing companies, built on top of GoHighLevel (GHL). Its defining idea: it's a **system of action**, not just a system of record — it tells you *what should happen next* and moves jobs automatically based on proof, instead of people dragging cards around.

**Core principle — jobs move only on proof.** A job advances a pipeline stage only when the evidence proves the new state is true. Three proof types (the "gates"):

| Type | Code | What it is | Example |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| **Evidence** | `ev_*` → stamps `dt_*` | A file/photo is uploaded | Completion photos uploaded |
| **Truth** | `tf_*` | A human confirms "Yes" | "Work Completed = Yes" |
| **Date stamp** | `dt_*` | Auto-recorded date when something became true | `dt_work_completed = 2026-06-21` |
| **Derived** | `sys_*` | A value the system computes from the above | `sys_closeout_ready = Yes` |
| **Segment** | `seg_*` | A category/branch selector | `seg_permit_required = Yes` |

"Drift integrity" logic catches manual moves / missing evidence and walks the job back to the stage its evidence actually supports.

**Pipelines:** Leads → Sales → Production → Warranty.

**The big migration:** move all workflow logic *out of GHL's drag-and-drop workflows and into Python code*. GHL stays the data + UI layer; Python (this repo) is the brain. GHL emits one generic "Opportunity Changed" webhook → our service figures out what changed and acts.

## 2. Where everything lives (IMPORTANT — two different repos)

- **LIVE code repo:** `AiEngineer101/ghl-2`, branch **`main`**. This repo (code only — `app.py`, `handlers/`, etc. at the root). Auto-deploys to Render on every push to `main`.
  - Live service URL: **https://ghl-shadow.onrender.com** (the Render *service* is named "ghl-shadow"; the empty repo `AiEngineer101/ghl-shadow` is NOT used).
  - Local clone: `C:\Users\Dhruv\ghl-2`.
  - This repo is isolated under the `AiEngineer101` account on purpose, to keep the Render/GHL keys away from the client.
- **DOCS / context repo (read-only to us):** `dbsmartroof/smartroofing`. The original repo, branches `main` / `dhruv` / `Bill-Kimberlin`. We were given a **zip snapshot** at `C:\Users\Dhruv\Desktop\smartroofing_repo_2026-06-21.zip`.
  - The `Bill-Kimberlin-branch (docs)` folder is the **up-to-date spec/documentation** — our source of truth for *what to build*. **Never edit it.**
  - The zip's `dhruv` / `main` branches are stale — ignore for live work.
- **Meeting transcripts:** `C:\Users\Dhruv\Downloads\smart_roofing_meeting_notes (1).md` (7 meetings, 2026-06-01 → 06-19).

**Roles:** Greg/Bill (client; Bill owns the documentation), Steve (business). Dhruv (developer; `adityachauhan@aisolv.io`).

## 3. How the live engine works

```
GHL event (Opportunity Changed)  ──webhook──▶  POST /webhook/ghl
        │                                            │
        │   (a "| Py" bridge workflow in GHL          ▼
        │    forwards Production events)        1. save raw event
        │                                       2. fetch full opp from GHL (read-only GET)
        │                                       3. run every handler → record a Decision
        │                                       4. if writes ON & decision is would_* → PUT back to GHL
        ▼                                       5. return summary
   dashboard at /  shows the decision timeline
```

- **Shadow-state diff:** GHL only says "something changed," not *what*. The service compares against stored state to find the change and stay idempotent (no echo loops).
- **Shadow vs active:** each handler has `SUPPORTS_WRITE`. `False` = watch-only (logs "would do X" but doesn't touch GHL). `True` = active (actually writes). New handlers are added shadow-first, validated on the dashboard, then "cut over" to active **at the same time as** the matching GHL workflow is set to Draft (so they don't double-drive).
- **Write safety (defense in depth):** writes only happen if `WRITES_ENABLED=true` AND any one of: (a) the opp's pipeline is in the pipeline-allowlist — now **Production `88V9uYY6visCrtI9V0NR` AND Sales `9KlQhUS34GzTN9q34WKF`** (Sales cut over pipeline-wide 2026-06-27); (b) the specific opp ID is in the **opp-allowlist** `write_allowed_opp_ids`; or (c) the writing handler is in the per-handler allowlist `write_live_handlers`. Decision is pure in `write_guard.is_write_allowed`, enforced in `ghl_writer`. Because Sales is now pipeline-allowlisted, **every Sales opp is writable** — the opp-allowlist is redundant for Sales (kept, harmless). Shown in `/healthz` as `write_allowed_pipelines` / `write_allowed_opps` / `write_live_handlers`.
- **Decision types:** `would_move`, `would_stamp`, `would_rewind`, `skip_idempotent`, `skip_condition_unmet`, `skip_blocked`, `no_op`.

**Useful read-only endpoints (open GET, no secret):** `/healthz`, `/events?limit=N`, `/events/{id}`, `/decisions?limit=N`, `/` (dashboard).
**Secrets (in Render env, NOT shared with us):** `GHL_PIT` (GHL Private Integration Token), `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

---

## 4. Current state of the build (2026-06-21)

**Production pipeline is now FULLY in code and live (active writes).** 11 handlers registered, all active:

| Handler | Role | Stage / field |
|---|---|---|
| `gate-materials-verified` | gate (EV→DT) | stamps `dt_materials_verified` |
| `gate-work-started` | gate (TF→DT) | stamps `dt_work_started` |
| `gate-work-completed` | gate (TF→DT) | stamps `dt_work_completed` |
| `derived-closeout-cash-reconciled` | derived | sets `sys_closeout_cash_reconciled` |
| `derived-closeout-ready` | derived | sets `sys_closeout_ready` (the P50 gate) |
| `move-prod-p05-p10-install-scheduled` | mover | Ready for Materials → Production Scheduled |
| `move-prod-p10-p20-work-started` | mover | Production Scheduled → Job In Progress |
| `move-prod-p20-p30-work-completed` | mover | Job In Progress → Job Completed |
| `move-prod-p30-p40-closeout-pending` | mover | Job Completed → Closeout Pending |
| `move-prod-p40-p50-closeout-complete` | mover | Closeout Pending → Closeout Complete |
| `enforce-stage-truth-invariant` | enforcer | rewinds drifted stages (P05–P30 ladder) **+ P50 closeout-readiness guardrail → bounce to P40** |

**Cut over to active today (2026-06-21):** the four closeout handlers (`p30-p40`, `p40-p50`, `closeout-cash-reconciled`, `closeout-ready`). Their matching GHL workflows were set to **Draft** by the client: *Move Prod P30→P40*, *Move Prod P40→P50*, *Derived Closeout Ready* (+ a "Needs Review Dup"), *Derived Closeout Cash Reconciled*. (The earlier P05–P30 set was cut over before this session; `WF | Gate | MaterialsVerified` is Draft, `…| Py` is the published webhook bridge.)

**Verified live today (end-to-end on test job "Dhruv Singh"):**
- ✅ Full climb Ready for Materials → Closeout Complete, driven by proof, no manual dragging.
- ✅ At Closeout Pending it correctly **refuses to close** while any proof is missing.
- ✅ It only closed once all 3 docs + full payment were present.
- ✅ Drift: clearing work flags rewound the job to the correct earlier stage.
- ✅ "Closed stays closed" — the system never auto-reopens a Closeout Complete job.

**Bug fixed today:** `derived-closeout-cash-reconciled` used to *skip* (no write) when an amount was blank, leaving a stale `Yes`. Now a missing/blank payment counts as $0 → `No`. (Requires a contract value to be present; if not, it still skips to avoid spurious writes.)

**Test coverage:** 92 unit tests, all passing (`python -m pytest tests/`).

---

## 5. The closeout logic (P40 → P50), in detail

`sys_closeout_ready = Yes` only when ALL of:
1. `dt_completion_photos_received` present
2. `dt_coc_received` present
3. `dt_final_walkthrough_proof_received` present
4. `sys_closeout_cash_reconciled = Yes`  (= `amt_total_funds_received >= amt_contract_value`)
5. permit OK: `seg_permit_required != Yes` OR `dt_permit_approved` present
6. change-order resolved: no CO initiated, OR the chosen payer path is fully documented
   (crew chargeback / company-vendor / billable customer — each needs its own doc(s))

When `sys_closeout_ready` flips to Yes, `move-prod-p40-p50` moves the job to Closeout Complete.

---

## 6. KEY GOTCHA — files vs. date stamps (caused real confusion during testing)

**Uploading a file and the "received date" stamp are two different things.**
- When a file is uploaded, the EV→DT gate stamps a date like `dt_completion_photos_received` and that date is **write-once / permanent**.
- **Deleting the uploaded file does NOT clear the date stamp.** The closeout logic reads the **date stamp**, not whether a file is attached.
- The three closeout date stamps live in the opportunity's **"System – Derived (Do Not Edit)"** section (field-registry folder "System / Automation"), with UI labels:
  - 🗓️ Completion Photos Received Date
  - 🗓️ COC Received Date
  - 🗓️ Final Walkthrough Proof Date

**To truly reset a job for testing:** clear those date fields (in the System – Derived section) AND blank/lower the payment, then move the Stage back manually. Removing files alone does nothing. That section is "Do Not Edit" in normal operation, but clearing it manually is fine for a test reset.

## 7. Reference data

**Location ID:** `8aQHgJUX2bFYBHZ4Qizg`

**Pipelines:**
| Pipeline | ID |
|---|---|
| Leads | `9VqvEN51waGkTKuVSAmn` |

| Production | `88V9uYY6visCrtI9V0NR` |
| Warranty | `gAYzyAUrhsmthp8mNtUk` |

**Production stages (legacy code → name → GHL stage ID):**
| Code | Name | Stage ID | Entry proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| P05 | Ready for Materials | `c98f59ed-7b38-4dd6-ae64-01c5a6537894` | (base) |
| P10 | Production Scheduled | `7a4f2d75-f033-4971-8eed-8ca4285e639e` | `dt_install_scheduled` |

## 8. Open questions / known gaps

1. **Should an invalid Closeout Complete bounce back?** — **ANSWERED by Bill (06-23), BUILT 2026-06-24.** Yes: `closeout-complete.md` §5 specs a **readiness guardrail** — if a job reaches Closeout Complete while it is not closeout-ready, the Code OS bounces it back to Closeout Pending and surfaces the missing item. ✅ Now implemented in `enforce-stage-truth-invariant` (P50 → P40). Note: this is about *invalid* entries, not auto-reopening a legitimately-closed job.
2. **"Photos at their own step?"** — **ANSWERED by Bill.** `job-completed.md` confirms completion photos / COC / final walkthrough are **context-only** at Job Completed and **enforced at Closeout Pending** (intentional). Job Completed just auto-advances. Our build matches.
3. **Document content validation** (is the file genuine?) — still **deferred** to a future AI/OCR feature; human confirmation is today's validator.

---

## 9. Next steps

1. **Production:** done + verified. The P50 closeout-readiness guardrail (enforcer extension) is now **built + tested (06-24)** — remaining step is to **deploy + cut it over** (see §11.1 for pre-deploy checks).
2. **Sales pipeline:** IN PROGRESS (started 06-24). Being built **shadow-first** (`SUPPORTS_WRITE=False` on every Sales handler) precisely because ⚠️ **live Sales has no test harness** — handlers log "would do X" against real events for dashboard validation, and only cut over per-handler once proven (same playbook as Production). Sales stages: Inspection Booked (S10) → Inspection Complete (S20) → Scope Pending/Build Estimate (S30) → Job Pending Approval (S40) → Approved–Funding Pending (S45) → Initial Funding Received (S46) → Handoff To Production (S50) → [cross-pipeline] Production · Ready for Materials.
   - **Slice 1 BUILT + tested + DEPLOYED + VALIDATED (shadow):** `gate-front-home-photo` (EV→DT, stamps `dt_front_of_home_inspection_photo_received`), `gate-inspection-complete` (TF→DT, stamps `dt_inspection_completed`; requires the front photo first), `move-sales-s10-s20-inspection-complete` (S10→S20 when BOTH durable truths present).
     - **Validated 06-24 on the user's real test opp `U970gIvE6Q31JKTCGVNw`** (the ONLY opp to touch in Sales testing — see memory). Empty opp → gates `no_op`, mover `skip_condition_unmet` (proved pipeline + S10 stage IDs correct). After the user added the front photo + set `tf_inspection_completed=Yes`, replay flipped to: both gates `skip_idempotent` (dt=2026-06-24) and mover → `would_move` to S20. **This confirmed the Layer-1 field keys all resolve against live GHL** (the one unproven assumption). Read-only replay via `POST /webhook/replay {"opportunity_id":"U970…"}` (no secret needed; shadow = no writes).
     - Note: the opp stayed at S10 in GHL despite both truths stamped — the live GHL S10→S20 move workflow didn't fire (Draft, or GHL's manual-edit trigger quirk). Exactly the gap the Code OS closes once our mover is cut over to active.
   - **Slice 2 BUILT + tested (shadow), S20→S30:** `gate-insurance-scope` (EV→DT, stamps `dt_insurance_scope_received`), `move-sales-s20-s30-scope-pending` (job-type-conditional: **Retail** advances immediately; **Insurance/Hybrid** hold for `dt_insurance_scope_received`; unknown job type holds). Collapses the live build's Drafted timed "start-numbers" mover + active Insurance/Hybrid scope mover into ONE job-type-conditional mover keyed on durable truth.
   - **`move-sales-s10-s20` CUT OVER TO ACTIVE (06-24), opp-scoped:** SUPPORTS_WRITE=True. It only actually moves opps in the opp-allowlist (the test opp) because Sales isn't pipeline-allowlisted — the writer blocks every other Sales opp. First live Sales write path. Gates + S20→S30 remain shadow. New per-opp write guard (`write_guard.py`) + 6 tests. **Test count: 128, all passing.**
   - **`move-sales-s20-s30` ALSO CUT OVER TO ACTIVE (06-24), opp-scoped** (SUPPORTS_WRITE=True; same writer guard). So the test opp now rides S10→S20→S30 automatically. Gates remain shadow.
   - **VALIDATED LIVE 06-24 on `U970…` (Retail):** our code drove real PUTs **S10→S20 then S20→S30** (`executed=True` each; re-replays show `skip_idempotent`). Opp now rests at **S30 (Scope Pending / Build Estimate)**. Only the **Retail** S20→S30 branch is live-validated; the Insurance/Hybrid hold-for-`dt_insurance_scope_received` branch is unit-tested but not live-validated (set `seg_job_type=Insurance` on a test opp to exercise it). Field keys confirmed resolving: `tf_inspection_completed`, `ev_front_of_home_inspection_photo`, `dt_inspection_completed`, `dt_front_of_home_inspection_photo_received`, `seg_job_type`. NOT yet confirmed live: `ev_insurance_scope_doc`/`dt_insurance_scope_received`.
   - **P50 closeout guardrail is now DEPLOYED/live** (commit 7daab11, deployed 06-24 with this push) — §11.1 caveat resolved; it actively bounces an incomplete Closeout Complete job to Closeout Pending.
   - **Slice 3 BUILT + tested + ACTIVE (opp-scoped), S30→S40:** `move-sales-s30-s40-job-pending-approval` (job-type fork — Retail: `dt_estimate_presented`; Insurance: `dt_insurance_scope_received`; Hybrid: both; else hold). **No estimate-presented gate handler:** `dt_estimate_presented` is stamped by a GHL Documents&Contracts "Sent" event (gate-estimate-presented-dc.md), which our Opportunity-Changed-only service never receives — so we READ the date (live GHL D&C gate stamps it) and gate the move on it. 12 new tests (**140 total, all passing**).
   - **VALIDATED LIVE 06-24:** set `dt_estimate_presented` on `U970…` → mover flipped to `would_move` → cut active → real PUT moved opp **S30→S40 (Job Pending Approval)**. Confirmed `dt_estimate_presented` and the DEPRECATED `dt_estimate_doc_received` are distinct fields in live GHL (UI labels "Estimate Presented Date" vs "[DEPRECATED] Estimate Doc Received Date"). **Opp `U970…` has now ridden S10→S20→S30→S40, all moves by our code (Retail path).**
   - **Slice 4 BUILT + tested (shadow), S40→S45/S46:** `move-sales-s40-s45-funding-pending`. **De-branched** (§20/§21) — ONE universal contract truth `dt_signed_contract_received` (no job-type fork). On contract signed: if initial funding already in (`dt_ins_deductible_received` OR `dt_retail_deposit_proof_received`) → skip to **S46**; else → **S45**. We READ `dt_signed_contract_received` (stamped by the live universal SignedContract gate; UI label "Contract Received Date" — confirm key on validation). S45 bounce-back guard is Drafted/possibly-deprecated → NOT built. 9 new tests (**149 total**). Shadow until live-validated, then cut active opp-scoped.
   - **Slice 5–7 BUILT + tested, ACTIVE (opp-scoped) — full pipeline to Production:**
     - `move-sales-s45-s46-initial-funding` (S45→S46): job-type-agnostic; moves on first funding (`dt_retail_deposit_proof_received` OR `dt_ins_deductible_received`).
     - `move-sales-s46-s50-handoff-to-production` (S46→S50): moves when `sys_production_readiness`=Yes.
     - `move-sales-s50-production-pipeline` (S50→Production/P05): **CROSS-PIPELINE** — `execute()` sets both `pipelineId`=Production and `pipelineStageId`=P05; gated on `sys_production_readiness`=Yes. After the cross the opp is a Production job (Production handlers + Block-Production-Entry guard apply).
     - `move-sales-s40-s45` ALSO cut to active. **All 7 Sales movers now active (opp-scoped).** 17 new tests (**166 total**).
   - **🎉 FULL PIPELINE VALIDATED LIVE 06-24 — BOTH JOB TYPES:**
     - `U970…` (**Retail**) rode S10→...→S50→**Production/P05**, every move by our code. Retail passes straight through S20.
     - `HCkgP9gfjEJmTbN74ORq` (**Insurance**) also rode S10→...→**Production/P05** — and crucially **held at S20 for the carrier scope** (the adjuster step), releasing only once `dt_insurance_scope_received` was set; then scope alone advanced S20→S30→S40 (Insurance branch). Final S50→P05 cross done by our mover.
     - Cross-pipeline handoff succeeded both times (pipelineId+stageId written). Field keys confirmed resolving live: inspection/photo/job-type/estimate-presented/contract/retail-deposit/insurance-scope/insurance-deductible/`sys_production_readiness`. Both opps now rest at Production/P05, correctly held by Production movers (no `dt_install_scheduled`).
     - Note: several mid-pipeline moves fired via the still-active live GHL Sales workflows (mixed state); our movers concurred (`skip_idempotent`) at each step and performed the final cross. Insurance/Hybrid: Insurance now live-validated; Hybrid still only unit-tested.
   - **DERIVED GAP:** `sys_production_readiness` is a big job-type rollup (handoff-to-production.md §6) NOT yet computed in Python — our S46→S50 / S50→P05 movers READ the live GHL-stamped value. Build a `derived-production-readiness` handler later (analogous to `derived-closeout-ready`) for full migration.
   - **MIGRATION NOTE:** Sales movers are active but **opp-scoped to the test opp** (writer guard). Live GHL Sales workflows are still Published (some fire, e.g. S40→S45). True cutover ("everything in Python") = one coordinated switch: widen Python writes from opp-scoped to Sales-pipeline-wide AND Draft all live GHL Sales workflows together — only after the full pipeline is validated. Doing it piecemeal strands other live deals.
   - **KNOWN GAP (follow-up):** Sales movers write only `pipelineStageId`, not the `sys_last_good_stage_code` audit field the specs list (observed `System: Last Good Stage Code` stale at S10). Add last-good stamping to the Sales movers' `execute()`.
   - **Spec discrepancy resolved (logged):** the older `move-sales-s10-s20` workflow spec keys the move on raw `tf_inspection_completed=Yes AND ev_front_of_home_inspection_photo present`; the Layer-1 `inspection-booked.md` §4 (newer authority) says move on the durable DTs and "do not move on raw EV presence." **We followed Layer-1** (the validation above confirmed this works). Noted in the mover docstring.
   - **Test count:** 122 unit tests, all passing (was 92 pre-Sales; +30 across slices 1–2).
   - **Next slices:** S30→S40 (job pending approval — contract/estimate gates, job-type branched) → S45 (approvals) → S46 (funding) → S50 (handoff) → Sales→Production cross-pipeline handoff. Specs in Bill-Kimberlin `workflow/03-move/sales/` + `pipelines/sales/`.
   - Specs extracted to `ghl-2/_sales_specs/` (gitignored working copy — delete when Sales is done).
3. **Leads** and **Warranty** pipelines: not started.
4. **Document intake** (SMS / email / upload auto-routed to the right job): the strategic moat. Build after the core pipelines are stable.
5. **AccuLynx adapter:** first external-CRM integration (adapter-layer pattern; core logic unchanged, thin per-CRM adapter).

## 10. Operational notes (this dev machine)

- **TLS-inspecting proxy:** `git`, `curl`, and `pip` need the Windows CA bundle at `C:\Users\Dhruv\windows_ca_bundle.pem`.
  - git: `git -c http.sslCAInfo=C:/Users/Dhruv/windows_ca_bundle.pem …`
  - curl: `curl --cacert C:/Users/Dhruv/windows_ca_bundle.pem …`
  - pip: `pip install --cert C:/Users/Dhruv/windows_ca_bundle.pem …`
- **Deploy:** push to `main` → Render auto-deploys (~1–2 min). The `/healthz` handler list is a quick sanity check.
- **Auth:** GitHub access is via a per-session PAT on the `AiEngineer101` account (not stored in-repo). We do **not** have the GHL key, so we cannot write to GHL directly from a dev machine — only the deployed service can (via its `GHL_PIT`).
- **Checking what happened to a job:** query `/decisions?limit=N` or `/events/{id}` against the live URL — every handler decision is logged with an `executed` flag.

## 11. June 24 sync — Bill's docs update (snapshot `smartroofing_repo_2026-06-24.zip`, commit 99787f1, 2026-06-23)

**What changed in Bill's docs and how it affects us:**

- **CR-0026 — final stage renamed `Closed Won` → `Closeout Complete`.** Stage ID **unchanged** (`de0bc542…`), so our handlers (which key on the ID) are functionally unaffected. We updated the **display labels** in our code + this doc to match. ⚠️ Bill still needs to rename the **live GHL stage display** (it currently still reads "Closed Won"); Stage ID is the binding identifier in the interim.
- **CR-0024 — final-walkthrough field key confirmed** as `ev_final_walkthrough_proof` / `dt_final_walkthrough_proof_received`. **Our code already uses the correct key.** ✅
- **CR-0025 — COC required for ALL job types** (was mis-tagged Insurance/Hybrid-only). Mechanic unchanged (`dt_coc_received` not empty). **Our code already requires it for all.** ✅ (COC evidence field is `ev_coc_document`.)
- **CR-0022 — invented stage codes (P05/S10/PL_*) deprecated**; names + GHL IDs are canonical. We already resolve by Stage ID. ✅ (Note: our movers still *write* `sys_last_good_stage_code = P50` etc. — that's the legacy last-good tracking per the move spec's `fields_written`, not stage identity.)
- **CR-0027 — code-first build doctrine LOCKED** into the Charter (Musk Algorithm: question → delete → simplify → accelerate → automate-last; build in code, not the platform, by default). Reinforces our approach.
- **The closeout Layer-1 stage docs now EXIST** (`job-completed.md`, `closeout-pending.md`, `closeout-complete.md`) — the gap we flagged. **Verified: our closeout logic matches** the written Definition of Done (photos + COC + final walkthrough + permit-if-required + cash reconciled).
- **New (Sales):** Layer-1 docs for `inspection-booked` + `inspection-complete` — for when we build Sales.
- **New area (DESIGN INPUT — do NOT build yet):** the **Work Order engine** (`docs/code-project/work-order/README.md` + `docs/ghl-native/work-order-control-layer.md`). A future control layer between Sales & Production (drafts/validates work orders, recommends evidence-based moves, drafts field issues; object model deferred). Explicitly *not controlled doctrine / no build commitment* — must be reconciled to the SOT first.

**NEW build items this update surfaced (NOT yet in our code):**

1. ~~**Closeout Complete readiness guardrail**~~ — ✅ **BUILT 2026-06-24.** `enforce-stage-truth-invariant` now guards P50: if a job is at Closeout Complete while not closeout-ready (manual/owner drag, or proof later broke), it bounces the job back to Closeout Pending (P40) and names the missing item. Readiness is **recomputed from the proof fields** (shared `closeout_readiness()` in `derived_closeout_ready.py`), not read from the possibly-stale stored `sys_closeout_ready` flag, so it's correct within the same event. P40 is left alone (valid resting stage, no entry-truth gate). 6 new tests (92 total, all passing). **Still SHADOW vs live: code is merged + tested but NOT yet deployed/cut over** — this is a live-writer behavior change; before deploy, confirm no current P50 job is incomplete (it would be bounced on its next event), and note it now actively interacts with the §6 manual test-reset flow.
2. **Revenue Adjustments Subsystem** (Change Orders + Supplements) — `closeout-pending.md` §2 conditions 6 & 7 want derived rollups `sys_change_orders_resolved` / `sys_supplements_resolved` (both `[NEW FIELD — to be created]`). Each repeats up to 8×/job (~25% of revenue) and needs **repeating child records**, not opportunity-level single-stamp fields. **Future build** (see Bill's `backlog.md`). Our current code uses the interim CR-0003 change-order logic and does **not** handle Supplements yet.

## 12. June 26 — Sales gates active + webhook bridge LIVE + full auto-validation

**Headline: the Sales pipeline now runs end-to-end AUTOMATICALLY (GHL webhook → our code), validated live.** Test count **194** (was 166).

**What shipped today:**
- **`WRITE_LIVE_HANDLERS` per-handler cutover knob** (`write_guard.py` 3rd scope dimension + `config.py` + threaded `handler_id` through `_writers`/`ghl_writer`). Lets a single mover go pipeline-wide for real deals one stage at a time. Empty default = inert. Surfaced in `/healthz`.
- **3 Sales gates cut over to ACTIVE** (`gate-front-home-photo`, `gate-inspection-complete`, `gate-insurance-scope` → `SUPPORTS_WRITE=True`). Python now stamps the Sales `dt_*` dates itself (opp-scoped via writer). Idempotent vs the live GHL gates (both write the same write-once date).
- **Webhook payload fix** — GHL's **default** custom-data webhook puts opp fields at the ROOT (`id`, `pipeline_id`, `opportunity_name`…) with no `type`/`opportunity_id`/`customData`, so the old extractor dropped it. Added step 5 (root `id` + an opp marker). Refactored pure extraction into **`webhook_payload.py`** (deps-free, testable like `write_guard.py`).
- **`derived-production-readiness` handler BUILT** (`derived_production_readiness.py`, registered before the Sales movers) — computes `sys_production_readiness` from the job-type rollup (handoff-to-production.md §6), stricter permit gate (UNSET permit = not ready), missing-items diagnostic in the reason. **Closes the last "derived gap"** — our code no longer just reads readiness, it computes it. ACTIVE, opp-scoped.

**Webhook bridge is LIVE (the big unlock):** the client created `WF | Shadow | Opportunity Changed Bridge (Sales)` (Opportunity Changed → Webhook POST to `/webhook/ghl` with `X-Webhook-Secret`). Confirmed `WEBHOOK_SECRET` IS set + enforced on Render (probe: no/wrong secret → 401). **Key gotcha: "Allow Re-Entry" MUST be ON** — without it an opp enrolls once and later changes don't re-fire (this exactly explained "fired once then silent"). Also: GHL's Opportunity-Changed trigger is reliable on stage/value changes, laggy on custom-field-only edits.

**FULL PIPELINE VALIDATED LIVE, AUTOMATICALLY 2026-06-26** on Retail test opp **`rCZ51hZFEFO9EMaenXVZ`** (now in the write-allowlist alongside `YlKKKJ1WM6UaG5kIDh1h`): rode **S10→…→S50→Production/P05, every move executed by our code, triggered by GHL webhooks** (not manual replay), each confirmed via `executed=True` from a `source=webhook` event. The inspection-complete **gate** was also proven Python-owned (Drafted the GHL InspectionComplete gate → our code stamped `dt_inspection_completed`, `executed=True`, then `skip_idempotent`). Only manual nudge was setting `sys_production_readiness=Yes` (now superseded by the new derived handler).
- Note: GHL Sales **move** workflows are still Published, so some moves race — our code won S30→S40/S40→S45/S45→S46/S46→S50/S50→P05 here, but earlier (before drafting) GHL won S40→S45 / S40→S46-skip. There is **no standalone GHL "S10→S20" or "S45→S46" workflow** — those moves are embedded in other automations / the de-branched funding workflow.

**Migration status — Sales is feature-complete in code AND now pipeline-live; remaining is the GHL-side workflow drafting:**
1. **Pipeline-wide writes ARE ON (cut over 2026-06-27, commit `2c0d983`).** `write_allowed_pipeline_ids` now includes the Sales pipeline `9KlQhUS34GzTN9q34WKF` ([config.py](config.py)), so the writer PUTs for **EVERY Sales opp**, not just the test opps — every Sales gate, mover, and `derived-production-readiness` is live for all real deals. The opp-allowlist (`U970…`, `HCkgP9…`, `YlKK…`, `rCZ51…`) is now **redundant for Sales** but kept (harmless).
2. **⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED — Draft the live GHL Sales MOVE workflows** (+ the production-readiness derived workflow) so they stop racing our code. Now that pipeline-wide writes are on (step 1), this is the **immediate next step**: until it's done, the GHL workflows and the Python movers both drive the same real deals (double-driving). Confirm the GHL-side Draft state before trusting Sales automation on live deals.
3. **KEEP PUBLISHED (Python doesn't own these):** the **D&C `EstimatePresented` gate** (stamps `dt_estimate_presented` from a Documents&Contracts "Sent" event our service never receives) and any gate whose Python side is still shadow. The 3 Sales gates above ARE now active, so their GHL gates can be Drafted after per-gate validation (only InspectionComplete validated so far; front-photo + insurance-scope still rely on GHL).
4. **Measurement report is context-only** (`ev_measurement_report`/`dt_measurement_report_received`) — NOT a stage-exit gate; it only feeds production-readiness. (Caused confusion: adding it does not move S30→S40; `dt_estimate_presented` does.)

**Diagrams:** `docs/sales-pipeline-diagram.md` (Mermaid).

## 13. June 27 — Sales drift enforcer + last-good stamping (gaps closed)

Two follow-up gaps from the Sales review are now closed (test count **211**, all passing):

- **Sales drift enforcer BUILT** (`enforce_sales_stage_truth_invariant.py`, registered LAST among Sales handlers). The Sales analogue of `enforce-stage-truth-invariant` (which is Production-only): on every Sales event it recomputes the highest stage whose entry-proof holds and **rewinds** an opp that sits ahead of its evidence (manual drag, or a `dt_*`/`seg_*` cleared after the fact). Job-type-conditional at S30/S40 with three-valued logic — `ok` / `fail` / **`indeterminate`**: an unknown `seg_job_type` is NOT rewound (a missing branch selector must not bounce a deal), it's left as-is until the type is set. S50 recomputes production readiness from proof fields (shared `production_readiness()`), not the stored flag — same robustness pattern as the P50 closeout guardrail. Because `evaluate()` reads the pre-move snapshot stage, it never fights a legitimate forward move (sees current stage ≤ highest-satisfied → no_op). **SHADOW first** (`SUPPORTS_WRITE=False`) — Sales is pipeline-live, so it ships watch-only to validate on `/decisions` (healthy deals → `no_op`, only drifted → `would_rewind`) before being cut over to active. Flip to `True` + redeploy after validation.
- **`sys_last_good_stage_code` gap CLOSED.** All Sales movers (and the new enforcer) now stamp `sys_last_good_pipeline_code` (`PL_SALES`) + `sys_last_good_stage_code` (the S-code of the stage they set) in the same PUT, matching the Production movers. Stage identity is centralized in a new `handlers/sales_stages.py` (single source of truth: stage IDs, code map, ladder order) so the movers and enforcer can't drift apart. The S50→Production cross stamps the Production codes (`PL_PROD` / `P05`). Shared write path: `_writers.move_stage(..., last_good_stage_code=, last_good_pipeline_code=)`.

## 13. June 27 sync — Bill's webhook-first engine blueprint (snapshot `smartroofing_repo_2026-06-27`)

**No new CRs** (still CR-0027, 2026-06-23) — doctrine unchanged. The new material vs our prior CONTEXT is Bill's **`engine/` design folder + `workflow/reference/webhook-event-contract-DRAFT.md`** (authored 06-09/06-10) — his documented blueprint for the webhook-first, logic-in-code engine. It **validates the architecture we built** and **resolves the gate-ownership question**. Local copy (gitignored): **`_bill_docs/`** (`engine/`, `01-gates/` full gate inventory, `reference/` webhook-contract + R9-defects + pipelines-and-stages + field-registry).

**Our build matches Bill's documented design** — webhook-first, GHL as headless data+UI, shadow-state diff, read-back-before-write, idempotent echo-loop kill. **ADR-0001** (`engine/decisions/0001`): *no n8n, everything in code, Python (FastAPI) + Postgres, Docker, Azure Container Apps (prod) / VM (dev)* — agreed Dhruv+Bill 06-10. ⚠️ We run **Render + SQLite (interim)**; the documented target is **Azure + Postgres**. Scaling rule: shard by opportunity key (per-opp ordering); webhook ingestion never scale-to-zero.

**DEFINITIVE gate-ownership answer (supersedes the earlier "gates belong in GHL" framing — that was wrong):**
- **125/129 specs (60/64 gates) are Native** → fire on GHL marketplace webhooks (`OpportunityUpdate/StageUpdate/StatusUpdate/MonetaryValueUpdate`, `Contact*`, `AppointmentCreate`) → **owned by code**.
- **Only 4 `dc-to-dt` gates** (estimate-presented, signed-contract, insurance-contract, hybrid-upgrade-accepted) have **NO native webhook** → each needs **one thin GHL workflow** (D&C trigger → Webhook action). Plus `notify-estimate-viewed` (5th thin) + 1 scheduled (`override-owner-manual-move-window`, 10-min).
- So the doctrine target = **everything in code EXCEPT ~5 unavoidable thin GHL forwarders** (D&C has no native event). The 6 gates we built are all Native — correct to own in code.
- **Each D&C gate has a Native `ev-to-dt` fallback-upload twin** (`gate-signed-contract-fallback-upload`, `gate-estimate-presented-fallback-archive`, etc.) — the "doc uploaded" path **is** code-ownable; only "doc Sent/Signed via D&C" needs the thin workflow.

**Migration plan (§12) = exactly our playbook:** shadow → canary (drift detectors) → strangler per-slice (derived → leads → sales → ev-gates → prod → payment/closeout last → D&C thin-workflows) → full. **"One owner per spec — GHL or engine, never both."** Our per-handler cutover + draft-the-matching-GHL-workflow is precisely this.

**Spec↔code model — divergence to note (R2/§13):** Bill's preferred model is **declarative specs compiled by a generic interpreter (~80%)** + hand-written handlers for the complex ~20%, joined by `spec_id` with CI 1:1 orphan checks (PoC in `engine/proof/` for `gate-signed-contract-dc`). We are **100% hand-written handlers** (spec-anchored docstrings = the 20% pattern). Not wrong; revisit if we adopt the interpreter model.

**Bug cross-check to action (R9 / webhook-contract §6.1):** Bill flags the **3 Production movers record the WRONG `sys_last_good_stage_code`** — `p20-p30` stamps P05, `p30-p40` stamps P10, `p40-p50` stamps P20 (should be the destination P30/P40/P50). Our **Sales** movers now stamp last-good correctly; **[ACTION] verify the Production movers don't carry this copy/paste bug** before relying on last-good for Production reverts.

**Other documented design reqs (gaps vs our build, mostly fine):** webhook **signature** verification (R3 — we use a shared `X-Webhook-Secret`; acceptable interim), first-class **audit log** (R4 — `decisions` table covers it), **cold-start shadow backfill** (R5 — N/A while we GET the full opp per event), **kill switch** (R6 — `WRITES_ENABLED` serves it), **reconciliation poll** (§8.5 — not built; would double as missed-webhook recovery + drift re-check).
